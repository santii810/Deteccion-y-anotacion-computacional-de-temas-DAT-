The council voted 10 to 3 to override the veto. Siding with the mayor, Councilor George A. Darcy III of Ward 3, Councilor at Large Patrick J. O'Brien, and Councilor Stephen F. Rourke of Ward 8 voted against the override, echoing votes they made when the proposal came before the council in June. Councilor at Large Kathleen B. McMenimen, who voted against it in June, was out of the country. Councilor Edmund P. Tarallo of Ward 2, as council president, could have voted only if there had been a tie.
Several attendees said the council was ignoring the public.
